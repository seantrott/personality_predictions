# Replicating and Extending Schoenegger et al. (2024)

[Schoenegger et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08170) compare the ability of various LLMs and humans (lay vs. expert) to predict the correlations between items on a personality test. Here, I replicate one of their primary analyses, and extend it using a methodology developed in previous work ([Trott, 2024](https://direct.mit.edu/opmi/article/doi/10.1162/opmi_a_00144/121179)) called a **Number Needed to Beat (NNB)**.
